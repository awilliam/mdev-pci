mdev-pci: A stub mdev PCI driver

This driver supports binding to an arbitrary PCI device using either
the standard driver new_id, device driver_override, or ids= module
option functionality.  The PCI device is never accessed in any way, it
provides only a parent device for registering dummy mdev devices.  Each
mdev type perpetually indicates an available_instances value of 1,
regardless of the number of mdev devices created (this is valid per the
mdev interface spec).  The mdev device reports a vfio-pci device_api,
but currently has none of the implementation to open the device through
vfio, ie. it cannot be used with QEMU or other userspace drivers.

This is intended to provide an example driver for management of mdev
devices in association to a PCI parent device.
